Test 1 @ Nov 28th, 2016:

PUrpose:

See difference in FOV for different lenses.


lenses: 

#1 8mm focal length aftermarket. Found here: http://www.ebay.com/itm/122198892672

#2 Default pixy lens (2.8mm focal length)


Location:

Camera is 2ft off the floor and about 12ft from the goal. (This is not the height/distance for the tracking tests by the way) 
 

Conclusion:

The 8mm focal length lens seems to be the smallest FOV you would want to use.

There are some lenses with FOV's in between the 8mm and default lens that would be optimal I think.  I will get the 4mm one and compare it to these next month.
